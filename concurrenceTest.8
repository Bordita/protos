.SH NAME
concurrenceTest \- SOCKS5 proxy concurrency testing tool

.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP 10
.B  concurrenceTest
[ POSIX style options ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
concurrenceTest is a testing utility designed to evaluate the performance and stability of SOCKS5 proxy servers under concurrent load. It spawns multiple client processes that simultaneously connect through the proxy to a specified destination, allowing administrators to test proxy behavior under stress conditions.

.SH OPTIONS

.IP "\fB\-h\fB"
Prints help and exits.

.IP "\fB\-o\fB \fIproxy_addr\fR"
Address of the SOCKS5 proxy server.
Default value is \fI127.0.0.1\fR.

.IP "\fB\-p\fB \fIproxy_port\fR"
Port of the SOCKS5 proxy server.
Default value is \fI1080\fR.

.IP "\fB\-d\fB \fIdest_host\fR"
Destination host to connect to through the proxy (required).
This can be a hostname or IP address.

.IP "\fB\-P\fB \fIdest_port\fR"
Destination port to connect to (required).
Must be a valid port number between 1 and 65535.

.IP "\fB\-n\fB \fIn_clients\fR"
Number of concurrent clients to spawn (required).
Each client will establish a separate connection through the proxy.

.IP "\fB\-u\fB \fIuser:pass\fR"
Username and password for SOCKS5 authentication.
Use this option when the proxy requires authentication.

.IP "\fB\-v\fB"
Prints version information and exits.

.SH EXAMPLE

.EXAMPLE "./bin/concurrenceTest -d google.com -P 80 -n 10"
Test with 10 concurrent clients connecting to Google on port 80 through the default local proxy.

.SH BEHAVIOR

The tool creates the specified number of child processes, each establishing an independent connection through the SOCKS5 proxy to the destination. Each client performs the following sequence:

1. Connects to the SOCKS5 proxy 

2. Performs SOCKS5 handshake (with authentication if specified)

3. Requests connection to the destination through the proxy

4. Sends a simple HTTP request to the destination

5. Maintains the connection until terminated

The test continues until manually terminated with SIGINT (Ctrl+C) or SIGTERM.

.SH SIGNALS

.IP "\fBSIGINT, SIGTERM\fR"
Gracefully terminates all client processes and exits.

.IP "\fBSIGUSR1\fR"
Sent to child processes to request graceful shutdown.

.SH EXIT STATUS

.IP "\fB0\fR"
Successful execution or graceful termination.

.IP "\fB1\fR"
Error in argument parsing, connection failure, or other runtime error.

.SH NOTES

This tool is designed for testing purposes and should be used responsibly. When testing against external destinations, ensure you have permission to generate the intended traffic load.

The tool supports both IPv4 and IPv6 destinations.
